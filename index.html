  <h2>
    Hi there!
  </h2>
  <p class = "anvi">
      Hi Im Anva, and I'm a great fan of Steve the Llama. <br>
      A little about me: I spent a large portion of my childhood living on a high hill
      over a tiny Mediterranean village before immigrating to the Big Apple.
    In my spare time you can find me practicing improv or locating jelly crepes.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
   When it comes to the front end, I will soon make ten months of being a self-taught coder.
   The idea of obtaining a position as a front end developer shifted from being a distant interest
   to a lifelong passion where I can translate my abstract thoughts onto clean code.
   I find it an ideal career with a load of perks and a never ending supply of fun things to learn!
   <br>
  <br>
   The design of this website was inspired by a dark, futuristic atmosphere.
   I wanted the website to hold a sort of mystery as you scroll, yet still possessing a simple
   outlook.
   I'm a huge fan of parallax scrolling, css hover animations and of course, the color black which
   is why these three factors were implemented into the design.
   The theme of the content was humorous, purposely to contradict the darkness of the front end.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
   The website was purely built by HTML, CSS, JS&JQuery.
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
